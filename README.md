# Horizontal-fragmentaion-based-on-data-semantics
There are many existing fragmentation method already available to us but the problem with these methods are that they can only be implemented when list of query is available.  Also most of the existing horizontal fragmentation method do not consider the data relationship for the fragmentation, but user usually query related data.So, In this project we have considered the data semantics or relationship for the fragmentation. Now for putting the related data together clustering technique will be used and after applying the clustering algorithm we will get different sets/clusters of related data. Now, after getting the clusters of related data we can divide our database into various fragments.
